**Tree Binary Segmentation** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the entertainment industry. 

The dataset consists of 2718 images with 2616 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class different classes (*tree*).

Images in the Tree Binary Segmentation dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 186 (7% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2022 by the Earthshot Labs.
